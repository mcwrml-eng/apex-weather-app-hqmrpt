To address this, I need more specific information about what \"incorrectly\" means. However, I can offer some general troubleshooting steps and design considerations:\n\n1.  **Identify the Issues:** Pinpoint the exact problems. Is it layout issues, broken components, incorrect data, or something else? Knowing the specific issues will help narrow down the cause.\n2.  **Review Recent Changes:** Carefully examine the code changes made in the recent update, paying close attention to the files mentioned, such as `app/circuit/[slug].tsx`, `app/(tabs)/calendar.tsx`, `components/WeatherChart.tsx`, `components/TrackMap.tsx`, `hooks/useWeather.ts`, `components/CircuitCard.tsx`, `app/(tabs)/f1.tsx`, `app/(tabs)/motogp.tsx`, `components/SearchBar.tsx`, and the layout files. Look for any unintended consequences of the changes.\n3.  **Check Dependencies:** Ensure all dependencies are compatible with the updated code. Sometimes, updating one package can break compatibility with others.\n4.  **Test on Different Devices/Platforms:** Verify if the issue is specific to certain devices or platforms (iOS vs. Android). This can help identify platform-specific bugs.\n5.  **Examine Error Logs:** Check for any error messages or warnings in the console or error logging system (if implemented). The `utils/errorLogger.ts` file might be helpful here.\n6.  **Rollback and Isolate:** If possible, revert to the previous version of the app and reapply the changes incrementally, testing after each change to isolate the cause of the issue.\n7.  **Layout and Styling:** Double-check the layout and styling, especially in `styles/commonStyles.ts` and the component-specific styles. Ensure that components are rendering correctly within their containers.\n8.  **Data Handling:** Verify that data is being fetched and processed correctly, especially in components like `CircuitCard`, `WeatherChart`, and `TrackMap`, which rely on data from `useWeather` and `data/schedules.ts`.\n9.  **Navigation:** Ensure that navigation is working as expected, especially with Expo Router.

These errors are related to React Hooks and their dependencies, as well as a conditional Hook call. Here's a breakdown of how to fix them:\n\n1.  **RainfallRadar.tsx:**\n\n    *   **Missing Dependencies in `useCallback` and `useEffect`:** The warnings indicate that several `useCallback` and `useEffect` hooks are missing dependencies. This means that the functions inside these hooks rely on variables that are not included in the dependency array. To fix this, you need to add the missing dependencies to the dependency array. For example, for the `useCallback` at line 143, add `RETRY_DELAYS` to the dependency array. Similarly, for the `useEffect` at line 170, add `isAnimating` and `toggleAnimation`. Repeat this process for all the other `useEffect` hooks in `RainfallRadar.tsx` as indicated by the linting errors.\n    *   **Conditional Hook Call:** The error at line 1237 indicates that a `useEffect` hook is being called conditionally. React Hooks must be called in the same order on every render. To fix this, ensure that the `useEffect` hook is always called, regardless of any conditions. If you need to conditionally execute code within the hook, move the conditional logic inside the hook itself, rather than conditionally calling the hook.\n\n2.  **SearchBar.tsx:**\n\n    *   **Missing Dependency in `useEffect`:** The warning indicates that the `useEffect` hook at line 27 is missing the `focusAnimation` dependency. Add `focusAnimation` to the dependency array of this `useEffect` hook.\n\n3.  **WeatherSymbol.tsx:**\n\n    *   **Missing Dependencies in `useEffect`:** The warning indicates that the `useEffect` hook at line 311 is missing several dependencies: `animationValue`, `opacity`, `rotationValue`, `scaleValue`, and `translateY`.

The key issues were:\n\n1. **Over-complicated retry logic** that was causing infinite loops\n2. **Too aggressive timeouts** that didn't give the API enough time to respond\n3. **Caching issues** in the WebView that prevented fresh connections\n4. **CORS problems** that weren't being handled properly\n\nThe new implementation is much more straightforward and should successfully connect to the RainViewer API.

Here are the key improvements made:\n\n### 1. **Enhanced Night-Time Detection in WeatherSymbol.tsx**\n\n- **Added support for actual sunrise/sunset times**: The component now accepts `sunrise` and `sunset` props from the weather API data for accurate day/night detection.\n- **Improved fallback calculation**: Enhanced the coordinate-based calculation with seasonal adjustments when API sunrise/sunset times aren't available.\n- **Better logging**: Added comprehensive console logging to track night-time detection decisions.\n\n### 2. **Corrected Night-Time Symbol Mapping**\n\n- **Fixed weather code 1 (Mainly clear)**: Now correctly shows `moon` at night instead of `partly-sunny`.\n- **Enhanced all weather codes**: Added proper night-time color variations that are darker and more appropriate for night conditions.\n- **Improved thunderstorm colors**: Made thunderstorm symbols darker at night for better realism.\n- **Better precipitation colors**: Rain and snow symbols now use darker, more muted colors during night hours.\n\n### 3. **Updated Component Integration**\n\n- **Circuit Detail Screen**: Updated to pass sunrise/sunset times from the daily weather data to all WeatherSymbol components.\n- **Enhanced Weather Forecast Components**: Updated `HourlyWeatherForecast.tsx` and `EnhancedWeatherForecast.tsx` to accept and pass through sunrise/sunset data.\n- **Maintained Backward Compatibility**: Components without sunrise/sunset data still work with the enhanced fallback calculation.\n\n### 4. **Key Technical Improvements**\n\n- **Accurate Time Parsing**: The `isNightTime` function now properly handles ISO datetime strings and various time formats.\n- **API Data Integration**: Uses actual sunrise/sunset times from the Open-Meteo API when available.\n- **Seasonal Adjustments**: Accounts for seasonal variations in daylight hours based on day of year.\n- **Coordinate-Based Fallback**: Enhanced calculation using latitude/longitude when API times aren't available.\n\n### 5. **Visual Enhancements**\n\n- **Realistic Night Colors**: All weather symbols now use appropriate darker colors during night hours.\n- **Proper Symbol Selection**: Clear nights show moon symbols, partly cloudy nights show `cloudy-night`, etc.\n- **Enhanced Animations**: Night-time symbols use appropriate animations like gentle glowing for the moon.\n\nThe fix ensures that:\n- \u2705 Clear sky at night shows a moon symbol instead of sun\n- \u2705 Partly cloudy at night shows `cloudy-night` instead of `partly-sunny`\n- \u2705 All weather conditions use darker, more realistic colors at night\n- \u2705 Accurate night-time detection using actual sunrise/sunset times from the API\n- \u2705 Proper fallback calculation when API times aren't available\n- \u2705 Consistent behavior across all weather forecast components\n\nThe weather symbols will now correctly display night-time variants based on the actual sunrise and sunset times for each circuit location, providing a much more accurate and realistic weather visualization experience."}, {"type": "lint", "status": "complete", "success": true}, {"type": "build", "build_type": "build", "status": "complete", "success": true}], "timestamp": "2025-09-11T23:25:05Z"}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Add a new section for all circuit locations for IndyCar"}]}, {"role": "assistant", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Okay, I will add a new section for IndyCar circuit locations.
